# responsive-images
css assignment


A HTML file and an external CSS file that shows responsive images using the <picture>, <source>, and <img> tags combined with a responsive layout driven by CSS media queries.

As the user adjusts the size of your page two things will happen:

1. The media queries in your CSS file will be altering the layout and the number of columns that appear on the page.

2. The media queries in your HTML <source> elements will be choosing the most appropriate size image file to load and display.
